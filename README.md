# velocity-picking

This is a tool, still in development, that allows you to visualize a CMP gather along with it's correspondent velocity spectrum.

At first, the program will display the velocity spectrum with the velocity picks obtained using a gradient regressor function, you can choose to use these velocities or to manually pick your own with the right click of your mouse on the next window. Then the program will proceed to show you the CMP gather with the NMO correction applied. You can export the velocity function you created to a txt file so you can use it on other programs.

The input data must be CMP ordered.
