# velocity-picking

This is a tool, still in development, that allows you to visualize a CMP gather along with it's correspondent velocity spectrum.

With the right click of your mouse you can manually select as many velocity picks as you want and then the program will proceed to show you the CMP gather with the NMO correction applied. You can export the velocity function you created to a txt file so you can use it on other programs.

The input data must be CMP ordered.
